# 📝 Graph Theory  - Where I Forge My Practice Problems
Welcome to my repository of exercises and notes on Graph Theory. This repository is created as part of my study and practice in Graph Theory, with the aim of systematizing knowledge, storing solution write-ups, and tracking learning progress.

# 📚 Content
The repository is organized by topic to help you quickly locate problems related to a specific algorithm or concept.

Basic exercises: problems on foundational concepts such as graph definitions, graph types, and graph representations.
Graph traversals: problems related to DFS (Depth-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search), Eulerian and Hamilton circle.
Shortest paths:
Dijkstra's algorithm
Bellman-Ford algorithm
Floyd-Warshall algorithm
Spanning trees
Prim's algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm
Max flow: exercises on Ford-Fulkerson and related concepts.
Others: advanced topics such as matching, graph coloring, etc.
# 🛠 Tools & Languages: C++

# 📌 Notes
This repository will be updated continuously as I add new problems. Stay tuned for updates!

Wish you happy studying!
